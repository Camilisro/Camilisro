### Hi there I'm CamilaðŸ‘‹
I am a person interested in design and marketing, since March 2021 I have been taking courses and training in this field. I currently work as a community manager at the Dental ABG dental office, and I also do logo designs and other similar things for different businesses/brands.
I communicate very well in English, I am studying at level B2, preparing to take the First.
I really like design, I am able to use programs like photoshop and illustrator.
I have my Instagram dedicated especially for my works @cam__dg .
I like to be learning all the time, I adapt quickly, I am a very responsible, reliable and punctual person.
